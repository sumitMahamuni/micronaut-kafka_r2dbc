# micronaut-kafka_r2dbc
This project is a lightweight, non-blocking microservice built with Kotlin and Micronaut. It listens to an Apache Kafka topic, deserializes incoming JSON events, and stores them asynchronously in a PostgreSQL database using R2DBC. Designed for local development and architectural comparison against a Spring Boot equivalent, it emphasizes simplicity, performance, and reactive design patterns.
